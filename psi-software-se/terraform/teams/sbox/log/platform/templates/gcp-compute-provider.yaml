# We want to add the ControllerConfig, Provider and ProviderConfig during the installation of Crossplane.
# Because the ControllerConfig needs some CRDs, which are not right there in the post-install step, we need to
# wait a bit until they are created. The same is for the ProviderConfig which needs CRDs created by Provider
# So the hook-weight here describe the order to be executed
