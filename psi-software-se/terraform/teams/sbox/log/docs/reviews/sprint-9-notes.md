#### Feedback:
**Andreas:**
- Asked about the purpose and use case of the IDP.
- Highlighted a specific scenario: setting up a nightly build server without dependencies.
- Confirmed the solution would free up significant capacity, specifically on the 4th floor.
- Inquired where the infrastructure would be built - Google Cloud or DC.
- Received confirmation from Denis that the setup would occur on Google Cloud, avoiding reliance on the internal infrastructure.
- ***Sounds amazing, it will free up a lot of capacities on the 4th floor***

**Matthias:**
- Gets asked a lot about *what problem is this team solving*?
- Pressed for a clearer roadmap and detailed timeline for deliverables.
- Asked what the first IDP deliverable would be for stakeholders; as example for identifying the timeline mentioned steps for implementing Jenkins multibranch pipelines.
- Pointed out that the presentation focused on the *what* rather than *why*.
- Stressed the importance of demonstrating **cost** and **time savings**, such as hours saved on setting up customer project (120h or 80h reduced to 10 minutes and still billed for hours).
- Suggested we should focus on emphasizing the benefits for the business to be able to argument the priorities; reminded that there will be a check whether we all *deliver* in the new setup 
- Suggested pilots (e.g., **SonarQube - static code analysis, log services**) to show early value before full scalability and before making it part of the Platform; suggested doing it in parallel to other capabilities
- Thinks he is now better equipped to tell other people what are the benefits of having an IDP
- Raised concerns about the skills required to use IDP, especially for teams with minimal Ops expertise.
- Highlighted the complexity of processes like container layering and distribution as potential barriers for some teams.
- Emphasized possible unwillingness of acquiring required new skills within teams using IDP 
- Requested clarity on what skills and activities would be required in teams (e.g., WMS) to use IDP effectively.
- Expressed disappointment that his team will not be the one to be first served by the IDP but sees value for the company in serving the OPS first
- Expressed concerns that the *whole LVS thing* was meant for people with minimal computer science background, thus will the *IDP* offerings be to techie for them
- Would see an internal web page with the presentation of the IDP potentially helpful only if it would depict common pains the teams are dealing with (the *why*) with pointing to the IDP as the solution
